	DMET Project "Thanks for giving us Bonus xD"
</h1>

<p class="paragraph">
	We did a simple rigging and animation using maya software, first of all we modeled the character "Boo" in assignment 3, then we added full joints skeleton in our model to
	make a full control of it,we bound the joints to the model then we added controllers to only the joints which we want to move. 
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	We then added some safety features to our animated model, We put the joints on a layer and make them unvisible so that the motion will be only throught the controllers, finally
	we animated 'Boo' by making she move its head, arms and legs and added key frames for each part and combine them in one animated video, at the end we make the 
	controllers unvisible as well.
